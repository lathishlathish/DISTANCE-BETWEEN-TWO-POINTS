# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:
## Step 1:
Using import math function,do the calculations.

## Step 2:
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.

## Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula.

## Step 4:
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.

## Step 5:
End the program.

```
import math
a=[4,2]
b=[10,6]
x1,y1=a[0],a[1]
x2,y2=b[0],b[1]
x=(x2-x1)**2
y=(y2-y1)**2
d=math.sqrt(x+y)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
